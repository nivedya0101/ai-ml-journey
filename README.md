# AI/ML Learning Journey ðŸš€

This repository tracks my progress as I study Python, Math for Machine Learning, and core AI/ML concepts.

## Structure

- `python-basics/` â€“ Python notebooks from Programming with Mosh
- `math-for-ml/` â€“ Notes and exercises from Coursera's Math for ML course
- `hackerrank-solutions/` â€“ My solutions to HackerRank problems
- `projects/` â€“ ML mini-projects I build during the 3-month plan

Stay tuned for updates as I learn and grow!
